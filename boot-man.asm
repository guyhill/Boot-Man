; Boot-Man
;
; (c) 2019 Guido van den Heuvel
;
; Boot-Man is a Pac-Man clone that fits (snugly) inside the Master Boot Record of a USB stick.
; A USB stick with Boot-Man on it boots into the game (hence the name). Unfortunately, however,
; Boot-Man leaves no room in the MBR for a partition table, which means that a USB stick with Boot-Man
; in its MBR cannot be used to store data. In fact, Windows does not recognize a USB stick with 
; Boot-Man in its MBR as a valid storage medium.
;
; Controls of the game: you control Boot-Man using the WASD keys. No other user input is necessary. Some other
; keys can also be used to control Boot-Man, this is a side effect of coding my own keyboard handler in 
; just a few bytes. There simply wasn't room for checking the validity of every key press.
;
; The game starts automatically, and when Boot-Man dies, a new game starts automatically within a couple of seconds.
;
;
; I've had to take a couple of liberties with the original Pac-Man game to fit Boot-Man inside the 510
; bytes available in the MBR:
;
; * The ghosts start in the four corners of the maze, they do not emerge from a central cage like in the original
;
; * There's just a single level. If you finish the level, the game keeps running with an empty maze. While 
;   it is rather difficult to finish the game (which is intentional, because of the single level), it is possible. 
;
; * Boot-Man only has 1 life. If Boot-Man dies, another game is started automatically (by re-reading the MBR
;   from disk, there simply isn't enough room to re-initialize the game in any other way)
;
; * Power pills function differently from the original. When Boot-Man eats a power pill, all ghosts become
;   ethereal (represented in game by just their eyes being visible) and cease to chase Boot-Man. While ethereal,
;   Boot-Man can walk through ghosts with no ill effects. While I would really like to include the "ghost hunting"
;   from the original, which I consider to be an iconic part of the game, this simply isn't possible in the little
;   space available.
;
; * There's no score, and no fruit to get bonus points from.
; 
; * All ghosts, as well as Boot-Man itself, have the same, constant movement speed. In the original, the ghosts
;   run at higher speeds than Pac-Man, while Pac-Man gets delayed slightly when eating and ghosts get delayed when moving
;   through the tunnel connecting both sides of the maze. This leads to very interesting dynamics and strategies
;   in the original that Boot-Man, by necessity, lacks.
;
;
; Boot-Man runs in text mode. It uses some of the graphical characters found in IBM codepage 437 for its objects:
;   - Boot-Man itself is represented by the smiley face (☻), which is character 0x02 in the IBM charset
;   - The Ghosts are represented by the infinity symbol (∞), which is character 0xec. These represent
;     a ghost's eyes, with the ghost's body being represented simply by putting the character on a 
;     coloured background
;   - The dots that represent Boot-Man's food are represented by the bullet character (•), 
;     which is character 0xf9
;   - The power pills with which Boot-Man gains extra powers are represented by the diamond (♦),
;     which is character 0x04
;   - The walls of the maze are represented by the full block character (█), which is character 0xdb
;
; Boot-Man runs off int 8, which is connected to the timer interrupt. It should therefore run at the same speed
; on all PCs. It includes its own int 9 (keyboard) handler. The code is quite heavily optimized for size, so
; code quality is questionable at best, and downright atrocious at worst.

; buildmaze: builds the maze. The maze is stored in memory as a bit array, with 1 representing a wall
;            and 0 representing a food dot. Since the maze is left-right symmetrical, only half of the
;            maze is stored in memory. The positions of the power pills is hard-coded in the code.
;            Adding the power pills to the bit array would have necessitated 2 bits for every 
;            character, increasing its size drastically.
;
;            Both sides of the maze are drawn simultaneously. The left part is drawn left to right,
;            while the right part is drawn right to left. For efficiency reasons, the entire maze 
;            is built from the bottom up. Therefore, the maze is stored upside down in memory

; int8handler: The main loop of the game. Tied to int 8 (the timer interrupt, which fires 18x per 
;              second by default), to ensure that the game runs at the same speed on all machines
;
;              The code first updates Boot-Man's position according to its movement direction
;              and keyboard input. Then the ghost AI is run, to determine the ghosts' movement
;              direction and update their position. Finally, Boot-Man and the ghosts are drawn
;              in their new positions. Collisions between Boot-Man and the ghosts are checked
;              before and after ghost movement. We need to detect for collisions twice, because
;              if you only check once, Boot-Man can change position with a ghost without colliding
;              (in the original, collisions are checked only once, and as a consequence, it is 
;              possible in some circumstances to actually move Pac-Man through a ghost).

; ghost AI and movement
; 
; Determine the new movement direction for each ghost. Ghost movement direction is determined by
; the following rule:
; (1) Every ghost must keep moving
; (2) It is forbidden for ghosts to suddenly start moving backwards. Unless Boot-Man just consumed 
;     a powerpill, in which case ghosts are forbidden from continuing in the direction they were going
; (3) Whenever a ghost has multiple movement options (i.e., it is at a crossroads), try moving 1 space
;     in each direction that is allowed, and calculate the distance to the target location after 
;     that move. Choose the direction for which this distance is lowest as the new movement direction
;
; During normal movement, ghosts target a position that is related to the position of Boot-Man, as follows:
; 
; number | ghost colour | target
; -------+--------------+-------------------
;      1 | purple       | bootman's position
;      2 | red          | 4 squares below Boot-Man
;      3 | cyan         | 4 squares to the left of Boot-Man
;      4 | green        | 4 squares to the right of Boot-Man
;
; There's two different reasons for having slightly different AI for each ghost:
; (1) If all ghosts have the same AI they tend to bunch together and stay there. With the current AI, 
;     ghosts will sometimes bunch together, but they will split apart eventually
; (2) With this setup, the ghosts tend to surround Boot-Man, making it harder for the player
; 
; When Boot-Man picks up a power pill, a timer starts running, and ghosts become ethereal.
; As long as the ghosts are ethereal, the 
; ghosts will not chase Boot-Man. Instead they will use the center of the big rectangular block
; in the middle of the maze as their target. They cannot reach it, obviously, so the result is 
; that they will keep circling this block for as long as the timer runs.
;
; This AI is related to, but not the same as, the AI actually used in Pac-Man. The red Pac-Man ghost
; uses Pac-Man itself as target, same as my purple ghost, while the pink Pac-Man ghost will 
; target 4 squares ahead of Pac-Man, in the direction Pac-Man is currently moving. The other ghosts' 
; movement is a bit more complex than that. I had to simplify the AI because of the limited code size.

; newpos: calculates a new position, starting from a position in dx and movement direction in al.
;         dl contains the x coordinate, while dh contains the y coordinate. The movement directions
;         in al are as follows:
;         0xc2: move right
;         0xc6: move down
;         0xca: move left
;         0xce: move up
;
; The reason for these fairly strange values is that they form the 2nd byte (the ModR/M byte)
; of the instruction updating the position: 
; inc dl (0xfe, 0xc2), inc dh (0xfe), dec dl (0xfe, 0xca), dec dh (0xfe, 0xce)
; The code first modifies itself to the correct instruction, then executes this instruction. The
; reason for doing it in this way is that this is a lot shorter than the traditional way of 
; doing an if / elif / elif / else chain.
;
; Immediately after calculating the new position we also determine the address in video RAM 
; corresponding to this position. All lines of the screen are stored one after the other in RAM,
; starting at 0xb800:0x0000. Since each line has 40 characters, and every character takes up
; two bytes (one for colour, one for the character code), the equation to calculate video RAM
; offset from x, y coordinates is as follows:
; 
; offset = 2 * (40 * y + x + 4),
;
; with the +4 due to the fact that the maze is in the center of the screen, with a 4 character wide
; border to the left.
;
; newpos and get_screenpos used to be two separate functions but since they were almost
; always called one after the other, combining them saved some bytes of code.

; int9handler: the keyboard handler. It converts the scancodes for WASD into valid movement 
;              directions, as described in the comment block above the newpos function.
;              We perform some bit wrangling to convert one into the other. This used to be
;              a simple if / elif / elif / else construction, but this bit-wrangling code is
;              much shorter, albeit much more obscure.
;              In the hope of documenting how this works, the comments show how these scancodes
;              are modified step by step into valid movement directions.
;
;              The reason that this works at all is that, coincidentally, WASD are in order of scancode,
;              (which is not a coincidence, as these scancodes reflect the geometry of the original
;              IBM PC keyboards), and that the lowest 2 bits of these are different for all 4.
;              Unfortunately, they are ordered in the wrong way: scancodes ascend while movement
;              directions descend. Therefore an extra minus sign is needed somewhere, which is
;              provided by the neg instruction.
